# ChromeTestExtension

A basic Chrome Extension to demonstrate how to create an extension that can retrieve details from a URL for a spesific domain (in this case https://stackoverflow.com/questions/)
The extension has the ability to pass the information to a companion app (written in C#) that sits on the user's machine that can then use the information in some way.
